IMPLEMENTATION OF A GENETIC ALGORITHM FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCHOOL COURSE SCHEDULES
###################

Scheduling is essential so that it makes effectiveness of teaching and learning activities and meet the targets of the predetermined curriculum provisions. In this case, sometimes the staff in charge of making the schedule of subjects have difficulty inputting and making scheduling which takes more than one day. In addition, the resulting schedule is less effective, such to the number of conflicting subjects. In this study, a school subject scheduling system was built using the Genetic Algorithm to minimize schedule conflicts. With this system, it is hoped that it will make it easier for staff to schedule school subjects because it is more time efficient, and the results of the arrangement of school subjects minimize clashes between subjects. The study results succeeded in making a school subject scheduling system that can be used by staff by approaching it through a crossover probability value of 0.9 and a mutation probability value of 0.4 with a total data of 126 subjects and the number of generations of 100 to perform iterations that produce a schedule of subjects in time 456,809981 seconds.
